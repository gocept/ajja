============
Contributing
============

All open-source projects live through their community, so does `ajja`.
You are very welcome to contribute bug fixes and feature proposals. Please
note the following guidelines:

* `ajja` is hosted on github: http://github.com/sweh/ajja

* Use github's issue tracker to submit bug fixes or feature proposals.

* Whenever possible, include a test demonstrating the issue.

* It is good practice to fork a project and make your changes through your own
  fork.

* Always send a pull request with a reference to the github ticket.

* Include enough information within your commit messages and pull request to
  help us understand your changes.

Don't be discouraged if a pull or feature request gets rejected. We will
always provide helpful comments or information explaining any issues with your
code and how to fix them.

A good and welcome start working on the project would be fixing or extending
the documentation.
