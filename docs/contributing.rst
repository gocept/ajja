All open-source projects live through their community, so does gocept.jsform.
You are very welcome to contribute bug fixes and feature proposals. Please
note the following guidelines:

* gocept.jsform is hosted on github: http://github.com/gocept/gocept.jsform

* Use github's issues tracker to submit bug fixes or feature proposals

* Whenever possible include a test demonstrating the issue.

* It is good practice to fork a project and make your changes through your own
  fork.

* Always send a pull request with a reference to the github ticket.

* Include enough information within your commit messages and pull request to
  make life easier for us.


Don't feel offended if a pull or feature request has been rejected. We always
provide reasonable comments or information's about how your code could be
improved.

Start by fixing or extending the documentation. ;)
