============================
Developing for gocept.jsform
============================

Installation::

  $ npm install
  $ grunt

To run tests in a browser, run::

  $ grunt test

To run tests in phantomjs, run::

  $ grunt phantomjs


Documentation
=============

The documentation is written in Sphinx and located under doc. There is a
Makefile that helps you generate the documentation from the sources. You'll
need to install sphinx globally or adjust the path inside the Makefile to your
needs.

Build the documentation with::

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    $ cd docs && make html
    $ open index.html

You can install the Sphinx package in your site packages or virtual environment
using pip::

    $ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt


You can make a JavaScript code block executable by giving it a label, i.e.

    .. _name-of-label:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        var foobar;

If marked this way the code block will be follow by a button labelled "Run",
which executes the JavaScript. (AJAX calls of gocept.jsform are mocked.
Also, a #form placeholder is provided.)
