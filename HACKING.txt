Documentation
=============

The documentation is written in Sphinx and located under doc. There is a
Makefile that helps you generate the documentation from the sources. You'll
need to install sphinx globally or adjust the path inside the Makefile to your
needs.

Build the documentation with::

    $ cd docs && make html
    $ open index.html

You can install the Sphinx package in your site packages or virtual environment
using pip::

    $ pip install sphinx
    $ pip install sphinxcontrib-autoanysrc
