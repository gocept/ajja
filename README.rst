gocept.jsform is a JavaScript library for simple creation of forms in your
clients browser. It just needs a JSON datastructure and creates a form with
auto saving fields from it.

Furthermore there is a list, table and group display for collections.

Uses *Knockout* for data-binding, *Handlebars* for templating and *jQuery*
for DOM manipulation and ajax calls.
